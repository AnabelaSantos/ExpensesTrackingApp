# Expenses Tracking App

## Description

Create an app to employees (users) upload their business expenses, track them and get reimbursed accurately and on time.

Users must be able to enter their expenses with a description, include a category so that they can see a breakdown of where they are spending most money and keep track of what they are spending with the business.
They must also be able to edit and delete expenses entries.

It would be beneficial, but not necessary, if the employees could upload a receipt to provide evidence and if they could click of button to automatically email the finance department with a breakdown of their unpaid expenses.
